        <p>That day started as with all days. You promise to meet and play.</p>

        <p>You were going to visit your kingdom again; that was the plan. You both wanted to finish building a big fort you had been planning. You meet in the woods, and they said they just wanted to take a detour and walk around before going to your tree.</p>

        <p>But nothing happened, even after hours; nothing happened because your friend did not show up.</p>

        <p>You waited and waited, at the tree and back at your houses, and you waited with their mother and your mother too, past sundown and into nightfall..</p>
  
        <p>They simply never came back.</p>
