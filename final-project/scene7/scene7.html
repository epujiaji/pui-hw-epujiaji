        <p>See the woods behind your house? That’s where you used to venture together. You pretend you’re adventurers in a world called the Unknown. A large tree in a clearing was the center of your kingdom, and between its giant roots you used to sit in turns and call it your throne.</p>

        <p>You used to run away from what you call the Beast.</p>

        <p>It’s all in your head, of course. An overactive imagination of a school kid.</p>

        <p>But you swear, some nights when you finish playing late, it was as if something was seeing you off at the tree line, watching you retreat to the glowing safety of your house.</p>
  
        <p>As if it’s waiting for you to come back again the next day, when the sun is up and bright.</p>
